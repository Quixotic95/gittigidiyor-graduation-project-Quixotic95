## Steps to Setup & Run

### Clone the project to your local

```bash
git clone git@github.com:113-GittiGidiyor-Java-Spring-Bootcamp/gittigidiyor-graduation-project-Quixotic95.git
```

### Go into project folder

```bash
cd .\gittigidiyor-graduation-project-Quixotic95\
```

### Since the project consists of two modules:

#### You need to run 2 bash windows at the same time.

* One for **loan-app (api backend)**
* One for **loan-app-thymeleaf (frontend)**

##### First, run the backend.

```bash
cd .\loan-app\
```

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

*Let the bash(cmd, powershell, git bash, etc.) run spring boot application.* And **do not close** it.

##### Then, run the frontend.

```bash
cd .\loan-app-thymeleaf\
```

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

*Let the bash(cmd, powershell, git bash, etc.) run spring boot application.* And **do not close** it.

* MongoDB Compass to see sent _**Sms**_ logging.
    * Hostname: localhost
    * Port: 27017
    * db: sms
    * collection: sms
* If you don't have MongoDB Compass, to see sms db collections just follow:
    * Go to location where mongo DB is installed “C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\ {version} \bin” and open PowerShell
      at that location. And execute these commands:

```batch
.\mongo.exe
```

```batch
use sms
```

```batch
db.sms.find({})
```

### Whenever you want to terminate the application completely

Just simply press Ctrl + C on the all running bash windows. Sometimes you need to press multiple times until the output "^C" is shown.
